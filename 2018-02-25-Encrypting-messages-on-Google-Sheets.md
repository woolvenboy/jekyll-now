Throughout today's lesson we mainly went over what we had done last lesson, but in more detail and with different techniques. We tried a few different ways of doing the same thing and made our already functioning encryptors even better. I found parts of this quite hard work at times as this part of IT does not come very naturally to me, but in the end I managed to use my knowledge in other parts of the subject to help me understand how it worked.

Since I had missed the last lesson I was slightly behind the others, but it only took me a short while to catch up. We also began to look at easier ways to make our work more accessible. We started with the format and layout. This wasn't very difficult for me and only took a matter of minutes. However it really does make a huge difference to the speed in which I could then work at.
