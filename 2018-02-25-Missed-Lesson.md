Sadly I missed today's lesson due to illness. However I did ask some friends on what I had missed during the lesson. Overall the lesson was mainly getting to grips with the simple parts of google sheets and encryption. 

I spent around 30 minutes at home working out how and what was going on in one of my peers work. This helped me to have a better understanding on what I had missed. I also saw how the use of VLOOKUP can be used in so many different and in fact very useful ways on sheets.
