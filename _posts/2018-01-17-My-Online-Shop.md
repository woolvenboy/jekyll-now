In today's lesson we mainly focused on our spreadsheets project. We started to delve deeper into the detail of how to make our shop more effective. 

To start with we looked at not just the product that you wanted to sell, but also the quantity of products as well. This small but very helpful tip has made my shop easier to use. Furthermore in many shops you will find that they have discounts and offers on, so i had to add this to mine. Firstly I had to put the overall discount in a percentage, this meant that when someone buys the product the percentage of discount is taken from the final price.

All in all I really found this lesson, in particular, very helpful. I have learned a lot of things that have made my understanding much better. But most importantly I have progressed and changed the way that I previously viewed my virtual shop.
