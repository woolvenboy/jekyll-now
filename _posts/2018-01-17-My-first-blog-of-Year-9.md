In today's lesson we started by refreshing ourselves of the work we had done last lesson. Firstly we recapped on the Google Spreadsheet we had started, this took some time, as a few people had forgotten what they had done. But in the end it we got started on some new and very interesting things that can help you, my teacher explained how what we are doing is basically how the till scanners in shops work. He later went onto explain that many people do this for a living and get paid lots of money for making relatively simple code. We then progressed to the next phase of our project. At this stage we had completed a checklist and we had a small database of items. But to make it even more interesting we now were asked to create a way in which a discount could be added to the original price. Later we went even further, and said that you only got the discount if you had bought more than five items. This prove to be much harder than the other problems we had had to solve. We all pondered on the situation for some time. But in the end we figured out a way to make this simple instruction into a reality on our monitors. After this our teacher showed us a simple way that you could change the amount of items you needed to get the offer. I found this very interesting but at the same time I wanted to find out what else was possible.

In the last fifteen minutes of the lesson I colour coded my different sections of my code so that it was easier to understand and so that I could work quicker.
