This lesson was mainly based around finishing our shops, but I would like to start off with saying that I have finally completed the final design of my blog by using style (scss).

To start with I added a new background to my surfing based theme, then I added a box around my writing, and added a shadow to the box to make it look 3D. I think that this really improves the overall effect of the blog. It also makes readers more enticed to read. Furthermore I am very happy that I managed to figure out how to make the white bar at the bottom of the page see through, as it came across as quite ugly and at times quite inconvenient. In conclusion I am very happy with the progress that I have made, as I had to completely restart my blog due to a technical difficulty.

Back to the actual lesson! We started by going briefly over what we had previously covered on our google sheets. I was pretty up to date with my work. Mr Tansley then showed u his finished shop, he didn't show us how his added extra inventions worked because that would be defeating the purpose of learning. I started by trying to build some of the extras that I had yet to install into my shop. I did this for the rest of the lesson, and then finished the rest off for homework. Overall I managed to get all of the things Mr Tansley had, the extratime I spent on the shop will hopefully pay off in the long run!
