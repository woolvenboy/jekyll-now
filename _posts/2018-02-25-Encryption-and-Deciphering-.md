In the previous week we had learned of to encrypt our messages using simple methods, however whats the use in being able to encrypt when you can't decipher the message as well. This is exactly what we learned how to do in this lesson. All in all it is quite simple, you just have to think logically about what we have already done. We could use all the things that we had previously learned to complete this. It took me and most other people a while to work out how this is done, but once given a few clues it became quite straightforward. 

Even though it may seem like a simple task this took us the whole lesson to fully understand, and be able to add it to our previous spreadsheet tooke even longer. Also even when I thought that I had completed it I found that I had missed out simple but at the same time quite easily missed out pieces of code, such as just one $.
