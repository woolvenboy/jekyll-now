This week was the week that we swapped teachers. This means that we also started a new type of computing. However, at the start of the lesson both classes came together to have or talk on Computer Science GCSE. All in all I'm really not very good at computing so I probably wonâ€™t take this subject. But this doesn't mean I dont enjoy the subject. In the future I hope that the computing that I have learned over the last 3 years will really benefit me in year to come. 

The next section of the lesson was to see how we could use a program called python turtle to make different shapes and patterns. This meant that we wanted to find the quickest and easiest ways to perfect simple instructions. Some of the patterns that you could make were very complicated but the code used to make them was quite simple.
