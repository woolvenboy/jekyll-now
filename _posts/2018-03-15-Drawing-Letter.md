Today's lesson was all about extending our knowledge of 'python turtle’. We started the lesson off by looking at the different angles in which you have to use to send the turtle in certain directions. The direction that the turtle goes in is primarily based on the rules of a 180° line.

To practice these skills we then as a class decided to draw an 'A'. Although this may seem simple, in actual fact it takes a lot of time and is quite complicated. After we had done it as a class we had to go away and do it on our own computers.

Our last task was to make two more letters ourselves, this was also then our homework as well. So we now have three letters and three functions.
