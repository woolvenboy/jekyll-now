To begin the lesson we started by going through all of our homework. Some people hadn't done theirs which our teacher didn’t like. then we started by going through a quick and simple way to draw curves and circles. This meant that drawing O’s and D’s etc. After we moved on to drawing our T’s. we had been set the task of drawing one normal T, one 2D T, and finally a 3D T. This took most people the entire lesson as it was quite difficult. Most people struggled because of the angles and also the length of some of the sides were hard to work out. To solve this problem I used the technique of trial and error.
